# GLI.TC/H Goals + Mission
_this is taken from the [http://gli.tc/h/faq/](http://gli.tc/h/faq/) "why" section, as a starting point, this could use some work + specifically: re-wording so that it reads well for both "the public" && for grant/fundraising proposals/contexts_

We are glitch artists and enthusiasts ourselves. We think glitches have amazing potential for exploring aesthetic forms and theoretical ideas and raising awareness of the assumptions and politics embedded in the digital systems that have come to dominate our lives. 

We get excited and inspired when artists provoke, instigate and leverage glitches in interesting ways; when writers and theorists contribute considered perspectives on this practice, and generally when the glitch community digs into and pushes the conversation.

GLI.TC/H aims to create spaces that facilitate these kinds of activity. Where artists and enthusiasts can come together to share work, resources and ideas; challenge each others perspectives and collaborate on new projects and in new directions. 

Our efforts are to encourage, nurture and support the glitch art community by creating an open–yet structured–framework for sharing, chatting and experimenting.
