# GLI.TC/H Goals + Mission
_this is taken from the [http://gli.tc/h/faq/](http://gli.tc/h/faq/) "why" section, as a starting point, this could use some work + specifically: re-wording so that it reads well for both "the public" && for grant/fundraising proposals/contexts_

We are glitch artists and enthusiasts ourselves. We think glitches have amazing potential for exploring aesthetic forms and theoretical ideas and raising awareness of the assumptions and politics embedded in the digital systems that have come to dominate our lives. 

We get excited and inspired when artists provoke, instigate and leverage glitches in interesting ways; when writers and theorists contribute considered perspectives on this practice, and generally when the glitch community digs into and pushes the conversation.

GLI.TC/H aims to create spaces that facilitate these kinds of activity. Where artists and enthusiasts can come together to share work, resources and ideas; challenge each others perspectives and collaborate on new projects and in new directions. 

Our efforts are to encourage, nurture and support the glitch art community by creating an open–yet structured–framework for sharing, chatting and experimenting.

## CONSOLE PROCESS

"We reject: kings, presidents and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code." (David Clark, describing early Internet working groups) which breaks down in more detail as:

> Working groups make decisions through a "rough consensus" process. ~~IETF~~ GLI.TC/H CONSOLE consensus does not require that all participants agree although this is, of course, preferred. In general, the dominant view of the working group shall prevail. (However, "dominance" is not to be determined on the basis of volume or persistence, but rather a more general sense of agreement). Consensus can be determined by a show of hands, humming, or any other means on which the WG agrees (by rough consensus, of course). Note that 51% of the working group does not qualify as "rough consensus" and 99% is better than rough. ~~It is up to the Chair to determine if rough consensus has been reached~~ (IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures). _( we don't have a "Chair" so that last part doesn't apply... )_


small decisions should be left to working groups, for ex:
* "which pictures should we include in this grant proposal application?" is something the fundraising working group should decide
* "what time should we post the update to the weekend festival schedule?" is something the communications group should decide
* "what food should we order/prepare (and how much) for lunches during research week?" that's something the research week logistics group should decide ( in conversation with the budgeting group )
etc...

large decisions should be presented to the CONSOLE at large by the corresponding WORKING GROUP, for ex:
* the budgeting group ( in conversation with the fundraising group ) has drafted a budget for how to handle travel ( who gets how much money ), they present it to the CONSOLE at which point the CONSOLE deliberates
* the communications team has drafted the first official email blast to inform the glitch communities of the date for the next GLI.TC/H 2K** , they then present it to the CONSOLE at which point folks chime in w/thoughts/feedback/etc.

...there's a lot of grey area inbetween of course, what constitutes a small vs large decision i think is something we're going to have to figure out in practice
